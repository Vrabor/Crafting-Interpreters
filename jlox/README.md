This is mostly a reimplementation of the interpreter how it is built in the book.  
The differences currently are:
* Error handling: I tried using custom Exceptions for errors wherever i could. 1. to see how that works out in the end (i usually write programs without Exceptions) 2. to be able to implement several Backends for reporting the errors
